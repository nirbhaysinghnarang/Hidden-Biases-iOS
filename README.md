# Hidden-Biases-iOS
iOS version of the Harvard Implicit Bias Test, with a focus on racial bias. 

• Developed a native iOS application in Swift to help users identify inherent biases they hold. This app is a spin off of the famous psychological Implicit Association Test and analyses response times during categorisation of faces and words to determine specific levels of bias held by the test-taker.
• To learn more about how this app and IATs work, you can visit https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html
• No data is stored and all tests are fully anonymous. No direct affiliation with Harvard University.
